Interview resources and practice materials.

## Data Structures
- Dynamic Arrays ✓
- Linked Lists ✓
- Hash Tables ✓
- Stacks ✓
- Queues ✓
- Binary Search Trees ✓
- Trie

## Algorithms
- Sorting (insertion, selection, merge, quick, counting) ✓
- BFS ✓
- DFS (inorder, preorder, postorder) ✓
- Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)

## Patterns
- Arrays and Hashing ✓
    - 
- Two Pointers
    - Where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints.
    - The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray.
    - E.g., squaring a sorted array, triplet sum to zero, or comparing strings that contain backspaces.
- Sliding Window
- Fast and Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
- In-place Reversal of Linked List
- Tree BFS
- Tree DFS
- Two Heaps
- Top K Elements
- Subsets
- Greedy Algorithms
- Stack
- Monotonic Stack
- Graphs
- Backtracking
- Trie
- Island (Matrix Traversal)
- Modified Binary Search
- K-way Merge
- Topological Sort
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Bitwise XOR

## Personal Notes

- A lot of times, comparisons require n*n traversal. This can be avoided using a
    hashmap, two pointers, or a sliding window.
